# TechnoloJs

TechnoloJs is a system for particle physics and visual enhancement. Avaible on Unreal Engine 4.
Particles become more accurate with TechnoloJs' PhyJix system.
The visuals become more accurate to real life using TechnoloJs' VisualZ system, enhancing Normal Maps and other effects.

# How do i get this working?
You need to put this in a UE4 project. If some of the textures are bugged, be sure the Starter Content that UE4 provides with every new project is in the project.

# This is a buggy mess!
It is in alpha. Expect some bugs in it!
